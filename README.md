Torch God Tweaks provides a way to skip the event entirely, and some QoL features regarding torches, Torch God and Torch God's Favor.

**Torch God's Favor Recipe:**
* Toggle if Torch God's Favor will be craftable. Recipe:
    * Gold/Platinum Bar, x4
    * Torch, x100
    * Ice, Jungle, Desert, Crimson/Corruption Torch, x25 each
    * Crafted at Demon Altar

**Reverse Torch Swap:**
* Toggle if biome torches should turn into regular torches when picked up (only if 'Biome torch swap' is enabled)
    * This does not include Coral, Cursed, and Ichor torches
    * Separate toggles for Demon, Aether, and Bone torches as they either don't contribute to luck or have no dedicated biome

**Convert Torches Upon Hardmode:**
* Toggle if any torch that is near evil blocks will get converted to the corresponding evil torch when hardmode is first entered

**Prevent Torch God Spawn:**
* Toggle if Torch God should never spawn (its regular condition is 'in caverns & more than 100 torches nearby')

**Convert Torches When Clentaminating:**
* Toggle if any placed, convertible torch (that has a matching Solution) will get converted when Clentaminator is used
* This will only convert to/from regular torches, not Bone torches

**Affect Campfires:**
* Toggle if campfires should also be affected by this mod. Everything that refers to torches implicitely refers to campfires

Check the config for more details (__all options are enabled by default__).
