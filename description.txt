Torch God Tweaks provides a way to skip the event entirely, and some QoL features regarding torches, Torch God and Torch God's Favor.

Torch God's Favor Recipe:
* Toggle if Torch God's Favor will be craftable. Recipe:
    * Gold/Platinum Bar, x4
    * Torch, x100
    * Ice, Jungle, Desert, Crimson/Corruption Torch, x25 each
    * Crafted at Demon Altar

Reverse Torch Swap:
* Toggle if biome torches should turn into regular torches when picked up (only if 'Biome torch swap' is enabled)
    * This does not include Coral, Cursed, and Ichor torches
    * Separate toggles for Demon, Aether, and Bone torches as they either don't contribute to luck or have no dedicated biome

Convert Torches Upon Hardmode:
* Toggle if any torch that is near evil blocks will get converted to the corresponding evil torch when hardmode is first entered

Prevent Torch God Spawn:
* Toggle if Torch God should never spawn (its regular condition is 'in caverns & more than 100 torches nearby')

Convert Torches When Clentaminating:
* Toggle if any placed, convertible torch (that has a matching Solution) will get converted when Clentaminator is used
* This will only convert to/from regular torches, not Bone torches

Affect Campfires:
* Toggle if campfires should also be affected by this mod. Everything that refers to torches implicitely refers to campfires

Check the config for more details (all options are enabled by default).
